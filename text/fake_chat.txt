U:Hi
Hey there Dan
U:How are you?
I'm great
U:I'm really interested in computing and marketing, do you think your industry is right for me?
Computing and marketing are crucial parts of my job. I personally wasn't super interested in computing and I had to work hard to learn to love it.
U:What do I have to look forward to?
My favourite part of my job is that I can work really hard at work and then go home and focus on my family
U:Any last minute advice?
Try hard in school and just enjoy it
U:Thank you!
Your welcome, reach out to me anytime! :)
