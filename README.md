# KOBLE.

2nd place - CISSA Catalyst 2018 Hackathon.


Koble was our solution to the hackathon brief, which had the theme "Empowering Education".

Koble aimed to solve 2 problems:
  - Many young adults are lacking in occupational knowledge.

  - Companies, large and small, struggle to have a large presence amongst young adults.
  
  

Koble is a web app build with Node.js, express, and MongoDB that proides a platform for companies to mentor and arrange events for young adults to help them learn and be exposed to industry.

Koble offers two main use cases:

  - Browse information about companies on Koble, and connect with their registered employees
  - Companies can post events (workshops, panels, networking nights), and invite young adults on Koble.
  
  
Being a hackathon project, the repository contains working representation of what we imagine Koble would be like - not a fully functioning web app.
